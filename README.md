## Walkthrough

A run-down of the talk, the exercises and the solutions are discussed in the [Wiki](https://github.com/abinavseelan/introduction-to-redux/wiki)

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node and `npm` installed on your machine

## Get things working

- Clone Repository
- Install the dependencies

```bash
$ yarn

or

$ npm install
```

- Generate the client-side assets. This task has a watcher, so having a dedicated terminal session for this task would be better :smile:

```bash
$ yarn build

or

$ npm run build
```

- Run the application and visit `localhost:1337` :rocket:

```bash
$ yarn server
